aemstro
=======

set of tools used to disassemble and assemble shader code for DMP's MAESTRO shader extension used in the 3DS's PICA200 GPU
see http://3dbrew.org/wiki/Shader_Instruction_Set for more information

please note that the current iteration of aemstro is very experimental as we are still in the process of reverse engineering the instruction set. a more feature complete with cleaner code will become available in the future.
